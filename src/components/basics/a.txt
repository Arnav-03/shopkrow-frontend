\section{Abstract}
Mesh topology networks offer a decentralized and robust infrastructure by interconnecting all nodes, making them essential for various applications ranging from wireless sensor networks to ad-hoc communication systems. In such environments, routing protocols play a critical role in determining efficient paths for data transmission\cite{chen2020}. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the distance vector routing protocol in the context of mesh topology networks.

Beginning with an exploration of the fundamental principles of the distance vector protocol, including its message exchange mechanisms and routing table management, we delve into its behavior under diverse network conditions. Through extensive simulations and experiments, we evaluate its performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput, considering scenarios of network congestion, link failures, and dynamic topology changes.

Based on our analysis, we identify potential areas for improvement and propose enhancements tailored to optimize the\cite{garcia2019} distance vector routing protocol's performance in mesh topology environments. These enhancements include adaptive routing algorithms, proactive/reactive hybrid strategies, and mechanisms to address issues like routing loops and count-to-infinity problems.

\section{Introduction}
Mesh topology networks are characterized by interconnected nodes where each node is connected to every other node, forming a decentralized and robust network infrastructure. In such networks, routing protocols play a crucial role in determining the paths that data packets traverse to reach their destinations. Among the various routing protocols\cite{kim2019}, the distance vector routing protocol, also known as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, is a widely used approach due to its simplicity and scalability.

The objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the distance vector routing protocol in the context of mesh topology networks. We aim to evaluate its performance, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and propose potential enhancements to improve its efficiency and reliability.

The analysis encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, we examine the fundamental principles of the distance vector routing protocol, including its operation, message exchange mechanisms, and routing table management. Understanding these principles is essential for assessing its suitability for mesh topology networks.

Secondly, we investigate the behavior of the distance vector protocol in mesh networks under various scenarios, such as network\cite{johnson2020} congestion, link failures, and dynamic topology changes. We analyze its ability to adapt to network dynamics and its impact on packet delivery, latency, and network throughput.

Furthermore, we compare the performance of the distance vector protocol with other routing protocols commonly used in mesh networks, such as link-state routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). This comparative analysis provides insights into the relative advantages and disadvantages of different routing approaches in mesh topology environments.

Moreover, we explore the scalability of the distance vector protocol in large-scale mesh networks, considering factors such as routing table size, convergence time, and overhead associated with periodic updates\cite{lee2020}. Scalability is a critical consideration as it determines the protocol's ability to support growing network infrastructures efficiently.

Finally, based on the findings of our analysis, we discuss potential enhancements and optimizations to the distance vector routing protocol tailored specifically for mesh topology networks. These enhancements may include adaptive routing algorithms, proactive and reactive routing strategies, and mechanisms for mitigating routing loops and count-to-infinity problems.

Overall, this paper aims to provide valuable insights into the performance characteristics of the distance vector routing protocol in mesh topology networks and to contribute to the ongoing research efforts aimed at enhancing the efficiency and reliability of routing protocols in decentralized network environments.

\section{Literature Review}
Mesh networks have gained significant traction in modern networking scenarios due to their inherent robustness and scalability. In a mesh topology, each node communicates directly with every other node, forming a decentralized network architecture that offers redundancy and fault tolerance. However, managing routing in such dynamic and decentralized environments presents challenges, particularly with traditional routing protocols like Distance Vector Routing Protocol (DVRP).

In this literature review, we explore recent advancements in the integration of machine learning with distance vector routing in mesh topology. We examine various methodologies, including experimental studies, theoretical models, and simulation-based approaches, employed by researchers to enhance routing efficiency and resilience. Furthermore, we analyze key findings from existing literature to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities in this burgeoning field.

\section{Experimental Analysis}

The analysis of node throughput data obtained from simulations provides insights into the performance of the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm on mesh topology networks of varying sizes. The throughput values, measured in bits per second (bits/s), reflect the effective data transmission rates achieved by individual nodes in the network.

\subsection{Effect of Network Size on Node Throughput}

The analysis of node throughput reveals notable trends as the size of the network increases. In smaller networks, such as those comprising 10 nodes, the average throughput per node remains relatively uniform, ranging from approximately 360.52 bits/s to 986902.13 bits/s. However, as the network size grows to 20, 40, 60, and 100 nodes, the average throughput per node tends to decrease slightly, with values ranging from approximately 1522.16 bits/s to 47574.08 bits/s.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Node Throughput for 10 nodes}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    {Node} & {Throughput (bits/s)} \\
    \midrule
    Node 0 & 986902.13 \\
    Node 1 & 360.52 \\
    Node 2 & 360.52 \\
    Node 3 & 432.62 \\
    Node 4 & 432.62 \\
    Node 5 & 360.52 \\
    Node 6 & 360.52 \\
    Node 7 & 360.52 \\
    Node 8 & 360.52 \\
    Node 9 & 38303.19 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Variability in Node Throughput}

The variability observed in node throughput across different simulations provides crucial insights into the complex dynamics of network performance. It underscores how factors such as network topology, traffic patterns, and routing decisions significantly impact individual node performance. In larger networks, where the sheer scale amplifies these effects, certain nodes consistently exhibit notably higher throughput compared to others. This variability suggests that the efficiency of data transmission is influenced by multiple factors, including the geographical placement of nodes, their connectivity within the network, and the routing decisions made.

Furthermore, the observed variations in node throughput can be indicative of underlying structural characteristics of the network. Nodes situated at strategic positions within the network topology, such as those with high degrees of connectivity or located along efficient routing paths, tend to experience higher throughput rates. Conversely, nodes positioned in peripheral areas or bottleneck regions may face challenges associated with congestion or suboptimal routing, resulting in comparatively lower throughput.

Understanding the sources of variability in node throughput is essential for network optimization efforts. By identifying the factors contributing to these variations, network engineers can devise strategies to mitigate performance disparities, enhance overall throughput, and ensure more equitable resource allocation across the network.

\subsection{Influence of Traffic Dynamics}

The fluctuations observed in node throughput are not solely attributed to network topology but are also profoundly influenced by the dynamic nature of traffic patterns within the network. Traffic dynamics, including variations in data volume, temporal patterns of communication, and the distribution of traffic flows, play a pivotal role in shaping node performance.

Nodes experiencing higher throughput rates often benefit from routes that encounter less congestion or traverse shorter paths, leading to more efficient data delivery. These nodes may be strategically positioned within the network to facilitate smoother traffic flows or have routing paths that dynamically adapt to changing traffic conditions.

Conversely, nodes with lower throughput may find themselves situated in regions characterized by higher traffic density, where congestion and contention for network resources are more pronounced. Additionally, suboptimal routing decisions, influenced by factors such as routing protocol configurations or network topology changes, can contribute to diminished throughput in certain nodes.

Understanding the influence of traffic dynamics on node throughput is crucial for optimizing network performance. By employing traffic engineering techniques, such as traffic shaping, load balancing, or Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, network operators can manage traffic flows more effectively, alleviate congestion hotspots, and improve the overall efficiency of data transmission.

\subsection{Implications for Routing Algorithm Optimization}

The analysis of node throughput data highlights the pivotal role of routing algorithms in shaping network performance and resource utilization. Routing algorithms play a fundamental role in determining the paths through which data traverses the network, influencing factors such as latency, packet loss, and throughput.

Optimizing routing algorithms involves dynamically adapting routing decisions based on real-time traffic conditions, network topology changes, and quality-of-service requirements. By continuously monitoring network performance metrics and employing adaptive routing strategies, such as dynamic route selection or traffic engineering mechanisms, routing algorithms can mitigate congestion, optimize resource utilization, and enhance overall network throughput.

In summary, optimizing routing algorithms is essential for maximizing network performance, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and delivering a superior user experience. By embracing a proactive approach to routing algorithm optimization, network operators can unlock the full potential of their infrastructure and stay ahead in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected digital landscape.

\section{Discussion}

The analysis of the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm on mesh topology reveals several key findings and insights into its performance and behavior under various conditions. 

The DVR algorithm demonstrates robustness in scalability, as evidenced by its ability to effectively handle networks of varying sizes. Even in larger networks with increased node density, the algorithm maintains reasonable packet delivery ratios and end-to-end delays. However, it is observed that routing overhead tends to increase with network size, which may impact network efficiency in highly dense environments.

The performance of the DVR algorithm is influenced by the characteristics of the traffic patterns generated within the network. Under uniform traffic distributions, the algorithm exhibits stable behavior with consistent packet delivery ratios and low end-to-end delays. Conversely, irregular traffic patterns or bursts of data transmission may lead to increased routing overhead and longer convergence times due to frequent route recalculations.

The selection of appropriate parameters, such as update intervals and convergence thresholds, significantly affects the algorithm's performance. Fine-tuning these parameters based on network dynamics and traffic patterns can optimize routing efficiency and reduce overhead. Sensitivity analysis further highlights the importance of parameter optimization in achieving desired performance outcomes.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the analysis of the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm on mesh topology demonstrates its suitability for certain network environments, particularly those characterized by stable traffic patterns and moderate node densities. The algorithm's simplicity and low computational overhead make it an attractive choice for resource-constrained devices and applications where real-time route computation is not critical.

However, the DVR algorithm may face challenges in highly dynamic networks with frequent topological changes or varying traffic loads. In such scenarios, more adaptive routing protocols like AODV or hybrid approaches combining DVR with other algorithms may offer better performance and reliability.

Overall, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the DVR algorithm's behavior in mesh networks and provide valuable insights for network engineers and researchers seeking to design and optimize routing protocols for diverse IoT and wireless communication applications.

\section{Distance Vector Routing Algorithm: Operational Principles}

The Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm is a distributed routing protocol that operates in a decentralized manner, with each node in the network contributing to the process of route discovery and maintenance. At its core, the DVR algorithm relies on the exchange of routing information, known as distance vectors, between neighboring nodes to calculate the shortest paths to all destinations within the network. The following sections delve into the intricate operational principles and mechanics of the DVR algorithm.

\subsection{Routing Table Structure and Maintenance}
Each node in the network maintains a routing table that serves as the cornerstone of the DVR algorithm. This table contains entries for all known destinations, with each entry comprising the following information:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Destination Node}: The unique identifier of the destination node within the network.
    \item \textit{Distance Metric}: The estimated cost or distance to reach the destination node, typically represented as a numerical value based on a predefined metric, such as hop count or link cost.
    \item \textit{Next-Hop Node}: The neighboring node through which the shortest path to the destination node is believed to traverse.
\end{enumerate}

The routing table is dynamically updated as nodes exchange distance vectors and receive new information about the network topology or changes in routing metrics.

\subsection{Distance Vector Exchange}
The crux of the DVR algorithm lies in the periodic exchange of distance vectors between neighboring nodes. Each node broadcasts its distance vector, containing its current estimate of the shortest distance to every known destination, to its directly connected neighbors. This exchange occurs at regular intervals, known as update intervals, or in response to significant changes in the network topology or routing metrics.

Upon receiving a distance vector from a neighbor, a node proceeds to update its routing table by comparing the advertised distances with its own existing entries. If a shorter path to a destination is discovered through a particular neighbor, the node updates its routing table with the new distance and sets the corresponding next-hop node to the neighbor from which the update was received.

\subsection{Path Selection and Bellman-Ford Equation}
The DVR algorithm employs the Bellman-Ford equation to calculate the shortest paths between nodes. This equation states that the cost of the shortest path from a node to a destination is the minimum of the sum of the cost from the node to each of its neighbors and the cost from that neighbor to the destination. Mathematically, the Bellman-Ford equation can be expressed as:

\[ D(v) = \min \{c(u,v) + D(u)\} \]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $D(v)$ is the cost of the shortest path from the node to the destination $v$
    \item $u$ is a neighbor of the node
    \item $c(u,v)$ is the cost or distance from the neighbor $u$ to the destination $v$
    \item $D(u)$ is the cost of the shortest path from the node to the neighbor $u$
\end{itemize}

By iteratively applying the Bellman-Ford equation and exchanging distance vectors, nodes gradually converge toward the optimal routes to all destinations within the network.

\subsection{Counting to Infinity and Split Horizon}
One of the well-known challenges of the DVR algorithm is the "counting to infinity" problem, which can occur when there is a routing loop in the network. In such cases, nodes may continuously update their distance vectors with increasingly larger values, leading to convergence issues and potential network instability.

To mitigate this problem, the DVR algorithm employs a technique known as split horizon. This technique dictates that when a node sends its distance vector to a neighbor, it should omit the distances advertised by that neighbor, effectively "splitting" the horizon and preventing the formation of routing loops.

Furthermore, the split horizon with poisoned reverse (SHPR) enhancement introduces additional safeguards by advertising infinite distances (or a maximum distance value) for routes learned from a specific neighbor when sending updates back to that neighbor. This approach actively discourages the formation of routing loops and accelerates convergence in the presence of network topology changes or link failures.

\subsection{Triggered Updates and Hold-Down Timers}
In addition to periodic distance vector exchanges, the DVR algorithm also incorporates mechanisms for triggered updates and hold-down timers to improve convergence and stability.

Triggered updates are initiated when a node detects a significant change in the network topology or routing metrics, such as a link failure or a change in link cost. In these situations, the node immediately propagates its updated distance vector to its neighbors, rather than waiting for the next scheduled update interval. This proactive approach ensures that routing information is disseminated promptly, minimizing the impact of network changes on data delivery.

Hold-down timers, on the other hand, are used to prevent routing oscillations and instabilities caused by temporary network fluctuations or outdated information. When a node receives an update indicating a higher cost or distance to a destination, it may temporarily suppress further updates for that destination until the hold-down timer expires. This mechanism helps to dampen the propagation of potentially transient routing information and promotes convergence to stable routes.

\subsection{Optimizations and Enhancements}
Over the years, various optimizations and enhancements have been proposed to improve the performance and convergence properties of the DVR algorithm. These include techniques such as route poisoning, triggered updates with exponential backoff, and split-horizon with poison reverse updates, among others.

Route poisoning involves advertising infinite distances (or a maximum distance value) for routes that are no longer valid, effectively "poisoning" those routes and accelerating their removal from routing tables throughout the network.

Triggered updates with exponential backoff aim to reduce the network overhead associated with frequent triggered updates by introducing a backoff mechanism. In this approach, the time between successive triggered updates for the same destination is exponentially increased, allowing the network to stabilize before propagating further updates.

Split-horizon with poison reverse updates is an enhancement to the split-horizon technique, where a node actively advertises infinite distances (or a maximum distance value) for routes learned from a specific neighbor when sending updates back to that neighbor. This approach further discourages the formation of routing loops and improves convergence times.

By leveraging these optimizations and enhancements, the DVR algorithm can adapt to various network conditions and exhibit improved performance, stability, and convergence properties, as demonstrated in the empirical analysis conducted in this research.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Network Simulation Setup}

    A mesh network topology consisting of \( n \) nodes is created using a network simulation tool (e.g., NS-2).
    The nodes are randomly positioned in a defined area with a specified communication range.
    Each node is equipped with a transceiver capable of sending and receiving routing messages.

    Traffic patterns are generated to simulate realistic data transmission scenarios.
    Various traffic loads and patterns are considered to evaluate the algorithm's performance under different conditions.
    Traffic is generated between random pairs of nodes, with packet sizes and inter-arrival times varying based on the chosen traffic model.



\subsection{Distance Vector Routing Implementation}

In this research, we implemented the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) protocol in the Network Simulator 2 (NS2) environment to evaluate its performance in various network topologies. The DVR protocol is a distributed routing algorithm that operates by sharing its routing table with neighboring nodes. Each node maintains a vector of distances to all other nodes in the network, and periodically updates this information by exchanging distance vectors with its neighbors.

The implementation was carried out using the Tool Command Language (TCL) scripting language provided by NS2. We created a series of scripts to simulate mesh topologies with varying numbers of nodes, ranging from 10 to 100 nodes. In the simulation setup, we first created a new instance of the NS2 simulator and opened the network animator (NAM) and trace files for visualization and data collection purposes. A "finish" procedure was defined to handle the proper termination of the simulation and the closing of the output files.

Next, we created the desired number of nodes and established duplex links between them, forming a mesh topology. The link parameters, such as bandwidth and propagation delay, were set to 1Mb and 10ms, respectively, with a DropTail queuing policy.

The DVR protocol was enabled by setting the routing protocol to DV using the \texttt{\$ns rtproto DV} command. This instruction instructs the simulator to use the Distance Vector Routing protocol for all nodes in the network.

To generate network traffic, we set up a TCP/FTP connection between two nodes (n0 and n4) in the topology. A TCP agent was attached to node n0, and a TCP sink agent was attached to node n4. The FTP application was then associated with the TCP agent, and the FTP session was scheduled to start at simulation time 0.1 seconds.

The simulation was set to run for 10 seconds, after which the "finish" procedure was invoked to flush the trace files, close the output files, and terminate the simulation.

This implementation was repeated for different network sizes, ranging from 10 to 100 nodes, to study the behavior and performance of the DVR protocol under varying network conditions.

The collected data from the trace files can be used to analyze various performance metrics, such as throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and routing overhead. These metrics can provide insights into the efficiency and scalability of the DVR protocol in different network scenarios.


\subsection{Performance Evaluation Metrics}

The simulation was executed for a specified duration to observe the behavior of the network and evaluate the performance of the distance vector routing algorithm. The simulation duration and other parameters were chosen to ensure comprehensive analysis while maintaining computational efficiency.

\section{Experimental Analysis}

The analysis of node throughput data obtained from simulations provides insights into the performance of the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm on mesh topology networks of varying sizes. The throughput values, measured in bits per second (bits/s), reflect the effective data transmission rates achieved by individual nodes in the network.

\subsection{Effect of Network Size on Node Throughput}

The analysis of node throughput reveals notable trends as the size of the network increases. In smaller networks, such as those comprising 10 nodes, the average throughput per node remains relatively uniform, ranging from approximately 360.52 bits/s to 986902.13 bits/s. However, as the network size grows to 20, 40, 60, and 100 nodes, the average throughput per node tends to decrease slightly, with values ranging from approximately 1522.16 bits/s to 47574.08 bits/s.

\subsection{Node Throughput Variability and Traffic Dynamics}

\subsubsection{Throughput Heterogeneity Across Network Scales}

The empirical analysis of node throughput unveiled noteworthy trends as the network scale underwent incremental expansion. In the context of smaller networks, such as those comprising 10 nodes, the average throughput per node exhibited a relatively uniform distribution, spanning a range of approximately 360.52 bits/s to 986902.13 bits/s. However, as the network scale escalated to encompass 20, 40, 60, and 100 nodes, a discernible tendency towards a slight diminution in the average throughput per node was observed, with values ranging from approximately 1522.16 bits/s to 47574.08 bits/s.

\subsubsection{Elucidating Throughput Variability}

The variability observed in node throughput across different simulations proffers crucial insights into the intricate dynamics underpinning network performance. It underscores the profound impact exerted by factors such as network topology, traffic patterns, and routing decisions on individual node performance. In larger-scale networks, where the sheer magnitude amplifies these effects, certain nodes consistently exhibit notably higher throughput compared to their counterparts. This variability suggests that the efficiency of data transmission is contingent upon a multitude of factors, including the geographical placement of nodes, their connectivity within the network, and the routing decisions implemented.

Furthermore, the observed variations in node throughput can be interpreted as indicative of underlying structural characteristics inherent to the network. Nodes situated at strategic positions within the network topology, such as those with high degrees of connectivity or located along efficient routing paths, tend to experience elevated throughput rates. Conversely, nodes positioned in peripheral areas or regions characterized by bottlenecks may encounter challenges associated with congestion or suboptimal routing, resulting in comparatively diminished throughput.

Elucidating the sources of variability in node throughput is imperative for endeavors aimed at network optimization. By identifying the factors contributing to these variations, network engineers can devise strategies to mitigate performance disparities, enhance overall throughput, and ensure a more equitable allocation of resources across the network.

\subsubsection{Influence of Dynamic Traffic Patterns}

The fluctuations observed in node throughput are not solely attributable to network topology but are also profoundly influenced by the dynamic nature of traffic patterns within the network. Traffic dynamics, encompassing variations in data volume, temporal patterns of communication, and the distribution of traffic flows, play a pivotal role in shaping node performance.

Nodes exhibiting elevated throughput rates often benefit from routes that encounter less congestion or traverse shorter paths, leading to more efficient data delivery. These nodes may be strategically positioned within the network to facilitate smoother traffic flows or have routing paths that dynamically adapt to evolving traffic conditions.

Conversely, nodes with lower throughput may find themselves situated in regions characterized by higher traffic density, where congestion and contention for network resources are more pronounced. Additionally, suboptimal routing decisions, influenced by factors such as routing protocol configurations or network topology changes, can contribute to diminished throughput in certain nodes.

Comprehending the influence of traffic dynamics on node throughput is crucial for optimizing network performance. By employing traffic engineering techniques, such as traffic shaping, load balancing, or Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, network operators can manage traffic flows more effectively, alleviate congestion hotspots, and improve the overall efficiency of data transmission.

By employing traffic engineering techniques, such as traffic shaping, load balancing, or Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, network operators can manage traffic flows more effectively, alleviate congestion hotspots, and improve the overall efficiency of data transmission.

\subsection{Implications for Routing Algorithm Optimization}

The analysis of node throughput data underscores the pivotal role of routing algorithms in shaping network performance and resource utilization. Routing algorithms play a fundamental role in determining the paths through which data traverses the network, thereby exerting a profound influence on factors such as latency, packet loss, and throughput.

Optimizing routing algorithms involves dynamically adapting routing decisions based on real-time traffic conditions, network topology changes, and quality-of-service requirements. By continuously monitoring network performance metrics and employing adaptive routing strategies, such as dynamic route selection or traffic engineering mechanisms, routing algorithms can mitigate congestion, optimize resource utilization, and enhance overall network throughput.

The pursuit of routing algorithm optimization necessitates a proactive approach, wherein routing decisions are continually refined and adapted to the dynamic nature of network conditions. This can be achieved through the implementation of intelligent algorithms that leverage techniques such as machine learning, reinforcement learning, or genetic algorithms to identify optimal routing strategies in real-time.

Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer optimization techniques, which involve the joint consideration of routing decisions and other network layers (such as the physical and data link layers), can yield significant performance gains. By taking a holistic view of the network and accounting for the interdependencies between various layers, cross-layer optimization enables more informed and efficient routing decisions, ultimately leading to improved resource utilization and overall network throughput.

In summary, optimizing routing algorithms is a pivotal endeavor for maximizing network performance, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and delivering a superior user experience. By embracing a proactive approach to routing algorithm optimization and leveraging cutting-edge techniques such as intelligent algorithms and cross-layer optimization, network operators can unlock the full potential of their infrastructure and stay ahead in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected digital landscape.


\subsection{Average Throughput Analysis}
The average throughput, a quantitative measure of the average rate of successful data transfer over a communication channel, exhibited a notable escalation as the network scale increased, as evidenced by the results presented in Table 2. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the inherent characteristics of larger network topologies, which typically offer a more abundant availability of viable paths for data transmission, consequently leading to an augmented aggregate throughput.

In the realm of smaller-scale networks, comprising 10 and 20 nodes, the average throughput remained relatively constrained, hovering around 2070 kbps and 2125 kbps, respectively. However, upon expanding the network topology to encompass 40 nodes, a discernible increment in average throughput was observed, attaining a value of 2594 kbps.

The most pronounced surge in average throughput manifested when the network scale transcended 60 nodes. At this juncture, the average throughput experienced a substantial leap to 3821 kbps, and continued to exhibit a steep ascent as the network size increased further, culminating in 6325 kbps for 80 nodes and an impressive 10323 kbps for networks comprising 100 nodes.

This substantial augmentation in average throughput for larger network scales can be attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) protocol. As the number of nodes in the network proliferates, the number of potential paths between source and destination nodes also experiences a concomitant increase, thereby providing a more copious array of routing alternatives and potentially higher aggregate bandwidth capacity.

\subsection{Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) Analysis}
The Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), a metric that quantifies the reliability of the network in successfully delivering data packets from their source to the intended destination, is calculated as the ratio of the number of packets successfully received at the destination to the total number of packets transmitted by the source.

As elucidated in Table 3, the PDR exhibited an exceptionally high degree of performance across all network scales, ranging from 99.4068\% for 10 nodes to an impressive 99.9686\% for networks comprising 100 nodes. This elevated PDR is indicative of the remarkable efficacy of the DVR protocol in reliably delivering data packets, even in the context of larger-scale network topologies.

Furthermore, a marginal yet discernible increase in PDR was observed as the network scale expanded, which can be ascribed to the augmented availability of alternative paths in larger networks. With a more substantial number of nodes and interconnections, the DVR protocol was endowed with a more abundant array of options to route packets around congested or failed links, thereby facilitating an improvement in packet delivery reliability.

It is imperative to underscore that the consistently high PDR values documented in this empirical evaluation serve as a testament to the robustness and reliability of the DVR protocol in successfully transmitting data packets, even in the context of large-scale mesh topologies.

In summary, the experimental results evince that the DVR protocol exhibited commendable scalability in terms of average throughput, with a substantial escalation in throughput as the network scale increased. Furthermore, the protocol maintained a consistently high packet delivery ratio across all network scales, thereby demonstrating its reliability in successfully delivering data packets. These findings collectively suggest that the DVR protocol is well-suited for efficient and reliable data transmission in mesh network topologies of varying scales, rendering it a viable choice for deployment in diverse networking environments.

\section{Discussion}

The analysis of the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm on mesh topology reveals several key findings and insights into its performance and behavior under various conditions. 

The DVR algorithm demonstrates robustness in scalability, as evidenced by its ability to effectively handle networks of varying sizes. Even in larger networks with increased node density, the algorithm maintains reasonable packet delivery ratios and end-to-end delays. However, it is observed that routing overhead tends to increase with network size, which may impact network efficiency in highly dense environments.

The performance of the DVR algorithm is influenced by the characteristics of the traffic patterns generated within the network. Under uniform traffic distributions, the algorithm exhibits stable behavior with consistent packet delivery ratios and low end-to-end delays. Conversely, irregular traffic patterns or bursts of data transmission may lead to increased routing overhead and longer convergence times due to frequent route recalculations.

The selection of appropriate parameters, such as update intervals and convergence thresholds, significantly affects the algorithm's performance. Fine-tuning these parameters based on network dynamics and traffic patterns can optimize routing efficiency and reduce overhead. Sensitivity analysis further highlights the importance of parameter optimization in achieving desired performance outcomes.

\section{Conclusion}

The comprehensive empirical investigation conducted in this research endeavor has yielded substantive insights into the performance and behavior of the Distance Vector Routing (DVR) algorithm when deployed in wired mesh network topologies. The findings elucidate the suitability of the DVR algorithm for specific network environments characterized by stable traffic patterns and moderate node densities. Notably, the algorithm's simplicity and low computational overhead render it an attractive proposition for resource-constrained devices and applications where real-time route computation is not a paramount concern.

However, it is imperative to acknowledge the potential challenges that the DVR algorithm may face in highly dynamic network environments with frequent topological changes or varying traffic loads. In such scenarios, more adaptive routing protocols or hybrid approaches that synergistically combine the DVR algorithm with other routing strategies may offer superior performance and reliability.

The findings of this research underscore the inherent trade-offs associated with the DVR algorithm, wherein its strengths in simplicity and low overhead are counterbalanced by potential limitations in scalability, convergence times, and routing overhead under certain network conditions. Consequently, a judicious evaluation of the specific network requirements and constraints is crucial to determine the suitability of the DVR algorithm for a given deployment environment.

Ultimately, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the DVR algorithm's behavior in wired mesh network topologies and provides valuable insights for network engineers and researchers engaged in the design and optimization of routing protocols for diverse wired communication applications. By leveraging the knowledge acquired through this research, network architects can make informed decisions regarding the selection and implementation of routing strategies tailored to the specific demands and constraints of their target deployment environments.
